# 2-Adder README

2-Adder is a python exercise for brand-new python
developers who have no code experience. The project is meant to be completed in
4 steps/iterations in the order defined in the 
section below.

## Intro

The 2-Adder practice project will be a command-line
application that does 4 things:

1. Adds two numbers
2. Subtracts two numbers
3. Multiplies two numbers
4. Divides two numbers

Each of the four features should be implemented 
one at a time in the order that they exist
in the list above.

### Requirements

You must have python 3 installed on your machine

#### Recommended IDE

I recommend that you use this project
with the IDEA Intellij IDE with the python plugin
installed.

## Completing The Exercise

This exercise is intended to teach you
the most basic aspects of a simple command line
application and how to learn new coding methods
on your own.
